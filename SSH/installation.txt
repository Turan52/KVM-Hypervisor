Version: Ubuntu 22.10 LTS

1)sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
2)sudo apt install openssh-server (OpenSSH installation)
3)sudo systemctl enable --now ssh (enabling OpenSSH)
4)sudo systemctl status ssh (checking status of ssh)
5)ssh username@ip-address/hostname (Ip-address you can check using "ifconfig")

Note: SSH without password does not work after upgrading from 18.04 to 22.04.
Summary of the steps I have always performed and have always worked:

1)ssh-keygen -t rsa
2)cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 1331 user@server 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

"authorized_keys" - If you don't have this file, you will need to create this file.

Also,you have to create the ".ssh" directory and the "authorized_keys" file the first time.

Create the .ssh directory:

mkdir ~/.ssh
Set the right permissions:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Create the authorized_keys file:

touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Set the right permissions:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Optional:If you are planning to access KVM virtual machines outside from your Ubuntu 22.04 system, then you must map VM’s interface to a network bridge. Though a virtual bridge named virbr0, created automatically when KVM is installed but it is used for testing purposes.
That's optional, even if you have router it is not recommended to make changes.
For creating a network bridge, create the file ‘01-netcfg.yaml’ with following content under the folder /etc/netplan.

sudo vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

network:
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false
  # add configuration for bridge interface
  bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces: [enp0s3]
      dhcp4: false
      addresses: [192.168.X.XXX/XX]
      macaddress: XX:00:XX:XX:XX:XX
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.X.X
          metric: 100
      nameservers:
        addresses: [X.X.X.X]
      parameters:
        stp: false
      dhcp6: false
  version: 2

Note: These details as per my setup, so replace the IP address entries, interface name and mac address as per your setup.

sudo netplan apply (for applying changes)
ip add show (confirming the network bridge "br0")
